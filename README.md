# Interactive-Color-Picker
Interactive Color Picker using State Management Techniques and useState Hook


# Color Picker App

A simple color picker application built with React, demonstrating event handling and state management.

## Observations

### Event Handling

- React uses synthetic events for cross-browser consistency and better performance through event pooling.
- Event handlers are passed as props, promoting code reusability and organization.
- Event delegation is employed, with handlers attached to the component tree root.

### State Management

- React embraces immutable state updates, creating new state objects instead of modifying existing ones.
- State is encapsulated within components, promoting modular architecture and better reasoning about data flow.
- Shared state should be lifted up to the closest common ancestor component to avoid prop drilling.
- Hooks like `useState` and `useReducer` simplify state management in functional components.
- React optimizes performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders, updating only affected components.
